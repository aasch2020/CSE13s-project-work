# Assignment 1 - Pass the Pigs.

The program takes the amount of players and a seed for random as input.
The game of pass the pigs is played with a 5 sided asymmetrical dice, with the sides granting different points per side, or ending the turn without adding points.
The die is passed through the players in a cyclic fashion until a player reaches 100 points, the winning score.
