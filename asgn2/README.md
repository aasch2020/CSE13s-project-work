# Assignment 2 - A Little Slice of Pi.
This program approximates e, pi, and the square root with various methods. E is approximated using a tayler polynomial. The sqaure root is approximated with Newton's method. Pi is approximated with Eulr, bbp, Madhava, and Viete's methods.

#Run the following to build the program:
```
$ make mathlib-test
```

## Running
```
./mathlib-test -args
```
-a   Runs all tests.
-e   Runs e test.
-b   Runs BBP pi test.
-m   Runs Madhava pi test.
-r   Runs Euler pi test.
-v   Runs Viete pi test.
-n   Runs Newton sqaure root tests.
-s   Print Verbose statistics.
-h   Display program synopsis and usage.
