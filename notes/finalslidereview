Lec 2
	Curly brace is scope, local vars in scope
Lec 3
	0 always false, no int by default
	= != ==
	switch(opt)
		case 1:
	dont use goto
	while
	do while bottom test
	for(;;) is inf loop
Lec 4 functions
	define once declare once
	abstractions in parts of code
	function returns a value, cant return an array
	Cant start with a number or punctioation other than_
	Parameters, C uses call by value, copy is passed
	Can mimick call by ref using a pointer
	funct prototypes let us call before declare
	#include is a preporcesser directive and includes other c files in c file
	#define, defines a macro for program and does text replace
	Can do if statements in directives, #ifdef/#ifndef
	#pragma once also works
	extern, makes fuinctions or vars global
		functions are extern by default
		only declare outside of functiont
	Static
		Can be in or outside of function
		Scope of file in which it is declared
		Declared in the function if the variable needs to persist across function calls
	recursion
Lec 5 math
	Computers cant represent any inf set of number
	Base 8 base 16 base 36
	char short int long long long
	stdint.h
	Arithmetic in finite field, can overflow
	2sc, get additive inverse of m flip bits then add one
	Floating point numbers
		cant repr all reals
		single precision, aightm 8 bits exponent, 23 bit sign
		limits to floating point
		MSB vs LSB for endianess
	no such thing as real numbers
		arith ops
Lec 6 Num comp
	Usualy best to use lib
	trunctation errors exist
lec 7 array and str
	arrays are homogenous collection of elemtns
	one dimentions or two or more etc
	array start 0
	contiguous part in memory
	Matrices are 2d array
	in mem matrix is 1 d
	Matrix mult
	arrays passed by reference
	and is adr of
	sizeof() works when  compilor can see how bit something is in  memory
	array and pointer are related in many ways
	two things adr same thing with pointer
	find an item, return first index of the key if it exists
	Ordering array
		many diff ways
	string is an array of char with end in /0
	cant copy str
	buffer overflow, make sure you dont overflow the buffer
lec 8 pointers and dynamic mem
		ptr is a var that holds a mem address
		The var points to a location of an obj in memoery
		not all points contain in address, can have null pointer
		memory addresses
			memory is stored in registers that can be accessed by address, every byte has unique adr
		Pointers are point to adr they are assigned
		& is adr of 
		* is deref of pointer
		pointers have adr too
		ptr can return more than one vale from function, can pass actual value is difficcult
		pass by ref dupese pointer to stack
		Pointer arithmetic
			Since pointers are just addresses, ui can increment and decrement
			Can subtrat two pointer
			Can add a thing to ptr
		Array and pointer arithmetic
			adding two pointers is ???
	arrays can also be done as pointers,, where you add pointer
	Strings	 are technicall arrays
	pointer to pointeres to pointers to etc etc
	function pointers
		Points to executable code i memeory
lec 9 sorting
	puttin gthings into order order
	total and partial ordering
	sorting adds info and can merge lists and dupe detect quick
	many types of sort
	O(n^2) insertion bubble selection quick worst case
	Shell is O(n^5/2)
	merge quick and avg heap is O(nlogn)
	Comparison of execution times
	hea is a tree
		max heap, all childs are less than parent
lec 10
	stacks and queues
	Stakcs
		LIFO
	Queues
		FIFO
		can also be prio queue
			highest prio dequeued first
Lec 11 dynamic allocation
	allocating memeory for vars on the heal during run time
	Not like compiler time vallocation whicih s done by compiler
	We want vars beyond current scope ore need more mem
	Malloc calloc realloc and free affter use
	Heap is big region of unmanaged anon mem, slower read write due to pointer, but globally access using pointer
	valgr for mem leak GDB fo segfaul
Lec 12 recursion
	function defined in terms of itself
	a function call requires a stack frame, so many times recursive function make more stack frame
	Use recur for make stack clearer
	Binary search in ordered lists
	Recursion is natural for search
Lec 13 Make
	Makfile has laintext file that contains instructions for the make
	Typically resides in the same dierctory as soruce code is named makefile
	rule is a target with a set of dependecied and set of commands
	target is the name of a rule run by make x
	phony target is a trarget that does not make thing with its name
	make cclean all debug
	Can do vars in makefiles
	x = y, contents of the vars assignements are stores as is var as vars refs as refs
	make waits to expand var referencces until var is being used
	internal assign := operator are simply expanded vars and behave like vars in c
	?= occurs only if the var has no value yet
	+= concatenation
	dependency
		target of filename, depends if it has been modified or not etc
	topological ordering
		Think of targets in a Makeifle as vertices an DAG is directed edge in graph
	Whats a command
		action ot be done
	Auto vars, can do macro replacement
	can do shell in make
Lec 14 data comperssions
	Takes a msg or seq of msg and communicates them to the reveiving terminal
	All messages get noise from transmitter to receiver
	Entropy, defined as the measure of uncertqainty for occurance of event
	entropy is probability of getting a ceratin thinglog2(probability of a certain thing).
	Huffman coding
		takes a histogram, makes a pq of the things
		makes a tree
		make a code table
		outputs code of symbols and tree instructions
lec 15 bitvec and set
	bit is 1 nible is 4 byte is 8 half word is 16 word is 32 long word is 64
	Logical shift
		Lshift left zeroes are shifted in on right
		Lshift rihggt
		ARithmetic Rshift is sign bit cloned front
		High order nibble in a byte is most significan 4 bits
		Set is a thing set of things
			can union set, whi is two added
			SEt difference, things in set a not in set b
		Set coplement
			thing not in a set
		Seet can be repr as bits 1 is true 0 is false
Lec 17 linked list
	Each node has pointer to next node, nul at end
	good thing
		no fixed mem allocations
		No need to shift after insert or delete
		good for stack an queue
	Disadvangatges
		More memory useage for storing pointer
		No random access
		Reverse is hard in single linked
	Ciruclar single link, last to first
	Double link, F2b and b 2f.
	Sentinel node, dummy node for head and tail
	circular dbl link exitss too
Lec 18 tree and BST
	Tree is a type of DAG
	one path between nodes
	node have paren and child
'	Root is first
	Preorder travvy
		go the thing, then left then right
	Inorder
		Left then thing then right
	Postorder
		left then right then thing
	Lecel order, go by level use a queue
	BST
		ordered tree, less than is left more than is right
Lec 19 files
	files are named with extention does not matter in unic
	File access, sequanetial or random acces
	Creat delete open close read write
	Files hav directories which are sequential
	files are in various partitoins of disk
Lec 20 cryptography
	encrypt comething with cipher, only ppl with cupher can read
	one time pad is umbreakable, XOR with random bits, key is the XOr
	Distributing key is as hard as distr message
	Modern encrypt take too long ot break
	PUblic key crypto
		Pricate key cant be shared, only they can decrypt, public key can encrypt
			usuallky slow, for small data or for keys
	Dfifie hellman key echange
		echange keys by math
	RSA
		use power mmod
Lec 22 debug
	Bugs can be syntax, logicalm semantic'
	Hard to find location of bugs, assert makes sure things all aer as wanted at a pint
	prints statements can print event leading upt o bug
	scan-build, static analyzer during compile time
	valgrind, dynaic analysis during runtime
	static compile time and try everything dunamic catches what occer during runtim
	lldb, set breakpoints and debug
Language translators
	Input lang to output langouage
	Language translaters go to binary
	Comipler
		Pre processors include acros and # directives does with source code
		compiler Converts to assembly code in var steps
		assmbler
			One pass or two pass
			makes it into output file or .o files
			do binary
		Linker
			links the binaries into one executable
	Loader
		allocates and manages RAM
	memery is ram
		Has text, unint data, init data, heap, and stack
Processes
	Processes threads scheduling IPC
	Progam state, only one thing per ore at once
	Progeams exec ccode from instructiuons at addresses
	many programs access, protect access space
	L1 L2 L# on CPU
	main mem is DRAM
	Disk big slow mem
	Fixed mem multi partitoin, each memory space a partition for memory for a program, do not inter fear with each other
	multiprogramming
		Needs capability to relocate memory
		Keep the memroy separate
	base an dlimit
		Logical address, which is what the process sees, but physical address is sommewhere else, and thats where the program is actual running
	Allocating memroy
		Find large enough space for progam to run
		free mem, merge adjacent free
		Buddy alloc
			Allocate mem in powers of two, good for obj of varied sizes
		Virtual mem,give more mmemory than on system
			Keep recently used stuff in RAM, less used move to disk, but hide form process
			Give the program virtual addresses, and mem management unit translateds this to the physical address
		Paging and page table
			Unit of mapping is a page, page table entry translates a single page
'			Page table entry, each entry i the page table contains a valid big, set if this logical page num has a corresponding physcial frame
			Page frame number page in physical memory
			Referenced bit, set if data on the page has been accesesd
			Dirty modified bit, set if it has been omidifes
	Process are crated by OS, execution or other process
		end voluntary on normal or error, involuntary on fatal or killed by another process
	Procecss states
		created, reading, running, blocked, exit
		Scheduler picks process and manages waiting if waiting for io or something
	Multithread
		Allows single app less wait do more at once
		threads must function when used nulti at once, has to have aerror management
Multithread
	Process is a thing with code adata and state
	A process contains one or more threads, threads run concurrently
	Each thread makes its own thread in address sapce
	Threads can have something waiting and still have program running in one program
	threads ashare data
	The proess has main thread, you can make other thread from here, main thread end last
	context swap, pause exection of a thread for some reason to do another thread, save adnd reload data
	Joining a thread, makes sure all threads done
	Race condition
		Threads share memory, we dont know read and write happen back to back per thread
		Fix by?
		Crit region for mutla exclustion
			No two process in in one crit region
			No assume speed
			No process outside a critical region may block another
			A process may not wait forever for crit region
		DEADLOCK
		A set of process deadlocked when everythin ng is waiting for a resources cyclically
		Conditions for deadlock
			Mutual exclusion, each resoures at most one process
			Hold and wait, a process with resources and req more resourfes
			No preemption, cant force take away process
			Circular wait, must be chain of 2 or more proces where each is waiting for the next member
		fix deadlock
			step 1, pretent it doesnt exits just hope it doesnt
			Recovery,
				Preeption, take a resources from another process
				Rollback, do checkpoints, restart process if in deadlock
				Kill processes, kill one to undeadlock
			Prevent deadlock
				No mutual exclusion
					Allow a program to spol things into a resource, thus cant alwasy claimm it
				No hold and wait
					A process needs to request pre use, problem if proecss need to get mid exec
				No preemption
					Can take away resources, ususally no work
				No cicrular wait,
					Order the resources numerically, cant get from high prio
REGEx
	Series of char for search pattern
	matches chars and types of chars, can do greede match for one or more,
	Finite automata
		DFA
			Also called finite state autommata, single transition per letter, do type 3 grammar
			Rcoginze regex
		NFA
			Have many transitions per letter
		{ush down automata
			Stack type to grammar
Scripting
	Scipt commands and bash
