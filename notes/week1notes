Boolean Algebra
	and == &&
	or == ||
	not == !
	true=1 false = 0
	truth tables
	De morgan law, !(A&&A)=!A||!b and vice versa
	xor vs or
	xor, first or second not both, or is a xor b xor both
	xor is self inverting, ID element is 0, xor 1=!A
	In c, logical exprs have type int,
	use #include stdbool.h to build in boolean values
	if(condition){
		action;
	}else{
		other action;
	}
	nested if
	if else if else if...
	c evals booleans from left to right, and stops eval
	switch, like a multi case if
	add break statements to case
	goto is succ don't do it for the purposes of clarity how did I get here?
	looooops
	Wile is a top test loop, so is for
	can write anything as while statement
	do while, bottom test loop
	infinite loop while(1) do while(1)
	for(;;)
	break with break
	No factorial on asgn2
	factorial takes long and its gross
	WHEN CAN I GOTO
		non-local error handling
		if this thing sucks, go to, ie. escape exception
		
	== vs = dont get it mixed
	continue statement, skip rest of loop, use it sparingly
	Let's compute root(2)
		no library routine
		The subfield of writing numerial programs is numerical analysis
		sqrt(2)= x^2-2=0
		We don't know newton method
		we know it between 0 and 2
		look for it
		
	BINARY SEARCH
	have middle, lower bound, upper bound
	long double h=(x<1) ? 1 : x
		if x less than one make x one
	m = (l+h)/2
	if(m*m < x){
		l=m;
	}else(
		h = m;
Functions
	:Formal parameters
		This is the name of the param as it is used inside of the function body
	:Actual params
		This is the name of the value that is passed to the fuction, the vale can be copied to the formal param
		Or a reference to the actual parameter may be bound to the formal parameter
			In C we do this by passing a pointer using call be value
	Call by value
		Copy of actual param is placed in the formal param
		This is the only method in c
	Call by reference
		Used the pointer in funct, actually changes the value.
		Use the pointer not the value to funct as input
Ternary op
	in for statement
	h = (x < 1) ? 1:x, if less than one has to be one
BINARY SEARCH IS A WAY TO SPLIT HALF EVERY SEARCH
Swap values
	void swap(int *a, int *b){
		int temp = *a
		*a = * b;
		*b=temp;
		return;
	The asterisc says this is a pointer
	This is call by val with pointer thus call by ref
	Short circuit eval, if first is false in an and wont go second if first true in or same thing
Function protorype
	Says what the parameters, the return type and the function names
	return type function_name(parameters);
	they an either bet used in header files or declared at the beginning
	This is a preprocessor directive
	Before compilation c soruce files are proccsed by preprocessor
	It is a macro processor to transform programs
	MAcros in C do text replacement
	Past code of given file into current file
	Used to include functions defined into other libraries
	Header file is info of how to link with code
#define
	A preprocessor directive that defines a macro for the program
	The preprocessor does text replacement
	#define PI
	all PI is replaced
Conditional directives
	Preprocessor directives that use ocnditional statments
	ex
	#define MACRO
		#ifndef Macro
			controlled text
		#endif
	If macro is defined do the stuff
HEADER FILE
	for stuff shared by source files
	Function delare
	Macro definition
	Data structure
	enum def
	Global vars
	and # include req for compilations
	Uses extension/h
	Used for modules or abstract types
	use #ifnef or #pragma to make sure we not doing it twice
#pragma	what is pragma?
	every modern compiler supports #pragma once
	same as ifndef
#pragma once is cleaner
#ifndef is more portable
extern
	This extends visibility of variables and fucntions such that they can be called by any fil
	Functions are implicit extern
static
	can be declared inside and outside a function
	persists across function calls
	Declared inside function if the value need to persist across function calls
	Declared outside a function if the value of the variable needs to be accessed by multiple functions
	Static is only local
utility function
	defined as a static function in header file
	Only exists in file
	inline tells complir to replace funcction call with code
	use for short little functions
Recursion
	Funct call self
	SyntaX JUST LKE ANY other function
	ALWAYS HAVE EXIT CONDITONS TO PREVENT INFINITE
	Recursive is more compact
Functions let you repeat code
	Can return void scalars or pointer and structs
	no return array
	Snake case
	Formal param used insde body
	Actual params passed to function
	C only uses call by val
	Prior to function call please def protorype
LANGUAGE TRANSLATORS
	Code needs to go from C to binary
	computers dont get C
	they understand machine lang
	input lagn to out lang p
	machine code yucky'
	Old computer box
	you get assembly from the code
	PHASE 1:
		The source code to the preprocessorm makes hello.i
		pre-processor:
			handles #include #ifndef etc
			inlcude header files from other libraries
			remove comments
			Macroprocessor: replaces macro with corresponding def
		You get an intermediate file hello.i
	Phase 2:
		Compiler hello.i to assembly code hello.o
		7 steps
		Lexical Phase:
			uses FLEX
			takes text files and group into lexemes sks tokens
				Examples are keyword, operators, vars
		Syntax phase:
			Parses expressions and makes a parse tree to a syntax tree
			Parses steps by order
			Parser generator
				A representation of tkens generated from statements and expressions
				represented as a heirarchical tree
				Ex. breaks if into many parts
	Phase 3:
		Assmbler: assmbly code to object code
		Converts assembly instructions into binary
		ONE PASS:
			traverses throguth once, symbols used before defined must include errata
		TWO PASS:
			This is what's used
			Create a mapping of symbols to values, then replace symbols with their defs upon second pass
	Phase 4:
		Linker: add libraries to object code, makes executable
		Links hello.o with other object files an libraries
		merges into one executable
	Loader:
		lives in OS
		./
		Takes programs and stuff and puts into memory
		allocates memory
		Relocate fix all dependent locations and reallocate
		Loading: put machine code and data into processor
Memory:
	Each processor gets its own memory
	Text
	Init data
	Unit data
	Heap
	Stack
	If stack and heap hit its a RIP
Basically C->assembly->binary
	Links stuff too
