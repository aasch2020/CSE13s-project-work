Sorting
	Sorting is the act of putting things in defined order
	Lexicographical order
	Numbers can be sorted in order
	Why?
		We can add info to our data
		We can now make assertions of before after and etc
		We can search merge and dupe detect more efficiently
	Bogosort
		Enum all possiblities of orderings
		Pick the one that is in order
		This sucks
	Second idea
		Find smallest
		Swap with first object
		Cut array size dwn by one
		Do again
		And again
		And again
	
	Fourth idea
		First two elemetns
		If first greater than second swap
		Move on to second and third
		Continue on until last pair
		What do we know?
			Last elemetn of the array is largest
			ignore it
			Repeat this proceducre on the first n-1
		But wait what happened if we make no swap
			it's sorted
		in the best case we can only examine n-1 pairs
		better bubble sort
		ONe pass order the array tells us if the array is sorted
		We can still do better/
			Prove with math that we can sort in time proportional to n log n
		Thought experiment
			Array with disjoint pairs
			we have n/2 pairs but look at both so call it n
			If we put the elements of every pair in order that is a run of length two
			Nowe we take a pair of runs and merge into runs of length 4
			How many times can we double 1 before we exceed n log n
			Our sort finished in time proportional to n log n
			This is merge sort
	Shell sort
		Organizes data on a course scale(large gap) first 
		Then goes to the small scale
	Quisk sort
		Cut array in half and stuff
		I need to firgure this out
		Computational complexity
		Cut array in half each time
		nlogn
		There exists for any choice of pivot element that is an adversarial array that makes complexity n^2
	Heaps
		Lot's of types of heaps
		A max heap
			a single node is a heap
			It is a heap if the parent is a heep and the trees rooted at both childs are heaps
			A parent's value (key) is greater than that of either child
			There is no order among the children
			Take the biggest child to the top and a nother child up
	Using comparisons the answer is no
	If we use assumptions about the encoding we can do radix sort
	Summary
		Sorting is fundamental
		Analysis of algorithm complexity is imprtant
		Better algorithm
		you will need to sort a lot in ur career
