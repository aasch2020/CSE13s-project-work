Processes
Code data an stack
	Always has its own address
Program state
	CPU registers, program counter is uccner location in code
	Stack pointer
Oly one process can be running in a core
Programs exxeucutre cdoe
Each instruction has an address
And acces data each byte had an address
We want to think our prgrm is the only thing exec on comupter, we are wrong
And address space is the region of a computer's memory where a progrma executes, ideally is protected from other programs
HOw not program touch other
	The loaders could relocate the instruction by addressa base address
	Registers that point to first and last byte of program's memory (base register)
In an ideal world
	Fast and large and non volatile memory
	Real world has memory that i slarge, fast, or affordable pick 2/3
Memory hierarchy
	Faster memory more expensive
	cache small amount of fast expensive mem
		Cache(L1) on the cpu chip usually
		L2 may be on or off chip
		L3 cache, off chip, made of SRAM
	Main memory, medium speed medium price (DRAM)
	Disk
		many gigs of slow cheap non volatile
Can't execute a program on disk
memory manager handles this
Part of Mem manager
	OS(with drivers)
	Single process
GOal, lay these out in memory

FIXED PARTITON MULTIPLE PROGRAM
	Memory is divided into fixed size of various sizes
	Assign a process to a space when it's free
	Mechanisms
		Separate input queues for each partition, lets programs in one at a time
		Singel input queue, better ability to optimize CPU usage
MULTIProgrammed system performance
	Programs arrive at a certain time
	Lists amount of CPU needed per program
	Measure how busy/idle the CPU is
Sharing the CPU among processes

Memory needs to things, relocation and protection

The OS cannot be certain where a program is loaded in memory
	Variables and procedures can't use absolute locations
	Several ways to guarantee this(relocation)
The OS must keep processes memory separate
	Protect a process from other proccesses reading or modifying it's own memory
	Protext a process from modifying it's own program code
Base and limit registeres
	Special CPU registers base and limit
	Access to registeres limited by system node
	Address generation
	Physical address is location in actual mem
	Logical address locations from process pov
	Physical address = base + logical address
	Logical = logical - base
Allocating memory
	Search through region list to find large enough space
	Hole is place where no prgram
	List of hole
	How to choose hole?
		First fit: first hole prgrm will fit
		NExt fitL first suitale after previously allocated
		Best fit: tightest fit
		Worst fir: biggest possible
Freeing memory
	Allocation struvts must be updated when memory is freed
	easy with bitmaps, just set appropriate bits in the bitsmap
	LL, modify adjacent elements as needed
	Merge adjacent free regions into a single region
	May involve mergint two regions with the just freed area
Buddy allocation
	Allocate memory in poewres of two
	Split larger chunks to make two smaller chuks
	When chunk is freed, see if it can be combined with its buddy to rebuild a larger chunk
		This is recursive
Virtual memory
	Basic idea, OS hand out more memory that exists on the system
	Keep recently used stuff in phsical memory
	Move less revently used stuff to disk
	Keep all of this hidden from processs
	Especially helpful in multiprogrammed systems
	disk memory is SLOOOW
Use virtual memory even when we never got to disk
Vitusal addresses
	Programs uses virtual addresses that are local to the provess
	Hardware translates virtual address to physical address
Translation done by memory managemen unit
	On same chip as CPU
	Only physical adddresses leave the CPU/MMU chip
Physical memory indexed by physical addresses
Paging and page tables
	Virtual addresses mapped to physical addresses
	Units of mappin are called  apage
	all addresses in the same virtual page are in the same physical page
	Page tabl eentry contains translation for single page
Table translates virtual page number to physical page number
	Not all virtual mem has physical page
	Not every physcial page need be used
EX
	64 kb virtual mem
	16 KB physical mem
What's in the page entry table?
	Each entry in the page table contains
	VAlid bit, set if this logical page nuber has a corresponding physical fream
	{age frame number, page in physical mem
	referenced bit, set if data on page has been accessed
	Dirty(modified) bit: set if data on the page has been modified
	Protection info
Address translation architecture
	CPU gets virtual page number, goes to page table to see which virtual page
	Add the offset to the page frame num
	Then go to physical memory

Processes model
	Code that lives in an address space
	Each address space is a separate zone
	only one process can be active an an instant (per core)
		An instant can be very short
		run eaech in bursts quickly
When processies created?
	When we turn on comupter
		System initialization
	Creat with system call
		Use is create a new process
		Already running processes like user programs system daemons
When process end?
	Voluntary
	Normal exit/error exit
	involutary
		Fatal error, killed by other process
PRocess heirarchies
	Parent makes a child process
	Forms a hierarchy
		UNIX calls this a process group
		If a process terminiates its children are inherited by parent
Process states
	Created
	ready to run
	Running
	Waiting (memory)
	Exit
Transitions between states
	Process enter ready queue
	Schedule piskc processes
	Schedule picks a different process
	Process waits for an event such as I/)
	event occurs
	Process exits/(ended by other processs)
