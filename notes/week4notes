Dynamic allocation
	Allocatin gmemeory for vars during run time
	Different from static allocation
	Compile time allocation means memoery for named vars is allocated at compile time
Why is it good
	Stack space is limited.
	Sometimes we want vars to last beyind the lifetime of current scope
		Heap can be accessed outside of current scope
	We don't always know how much memory is needed to run a prgrm
	malloc or calloc
malloc calloc realloc
	dynamically allocate memory.
	Make a dynamic allocate memeory on the heap and returns a pointer of the allocated memory
	Allocated mem must be freed using free() Not freeing lead to depletion of resources. This is a memory leak
Heap
	A large region of unmanagedd anon memory
	Only limitations are your computers physical limitations
	Slower to read write bc pointers
	Using heap mem can be accessed global with access to ptrs
	Possible memeory fragmentation can occur as block of mem are allocated an deallocated
malloc
	void* malloc(size_t, size)
	returns ptr of size bytes on of unitilialized memory
	May contain junk data
	Doesn't check for overflow of [size] if its the result of an arithmetic op
calloc
	return void ptr
	calloc(zie_t, nmemmbm size_t size)
	nmemb denotes the number of objects
	Cleans memory for you
	return null ptr if not work

MAtrix thing
	matrix create
	int m does a ptr to a ptr, (int **)calloc(n, sizeof(n, (int*)))
		(int**) at the beginning says what calloc return
		This makes a ptr to an array of ptrs
	THis makes an array of ptr of
	delete matrix
		Loop through d1 look for all the things clear those
		then delete the first array
	rows don't need to be the same length technically
	
realloc
	want to make allocated memory bigger
	Reallocated the ptr to a new point at size byutes of allocated memory on the heap
	This is not srictly true
	Basically, if theres enough room to make it bigger it will add more space to the end of the memory
	If theres not enough memory contiguous there, it allocates a new one
	If it is less than the size of og alloc block it make it short

Dynamically growing stack

free
	We need to free allocated memory
	we must be able to dealloc or free memory
	Deallocates the memory space pointed to by ptr
	memory leaks occur if alloc memeory isnt freed
	Seg fault occurs if it tries to access memory location that it isnt allowed to access
	Pointesr that have been reed should be set to null to mitigate use after free vars
	Free then set ptr to null so you dont use after free
	
Detectin memory leak and seg fault
	gdb/lldb
	debuggers
	valgrind
	they should be used for debug
	infer from facebook
		static analyzer go over code and deduce whats wrong
	A collection of dynamic analysis
	Usualy used for memcheck
		Checks use  of uninit memory
		Reading/writing of memoery after it has been freed
		R/W off end of allocated blocks
		R/W inappropriate areas on the stack
		Mem leaks where ptrs to malloc's blocks are lost forever
	checks for unfreed stuff
Static analyzers vs dynamic analyzeres
	Static analyzers like infer operate by analyzing source code for prgrm pre run
	Compared against a set of coding rules
	Only surface level
	Dynamic analyzers 
		operate by tracking down error durin prgrm execution
	PUt infer on system

Recursion
	A function dfined in terms of itself
	SUm the first k natrual numbers
	sum can be calculated recursively
	calculate fibonnaci numbers
		can be done recursively
		Recursive is 2^n, iterative is O(n)
	IS it inherently inefficient
		A function call requires makinga stack frame that takes time and space
		All tail recursive functions can e rewritten as iteration
	The slowest thing in computer is storage then dram.
	If you can fit things in the cache it runs fast
	iterative version of algs fit in the cache so it fast
	The mem access cost can make it slower
Recursive algorithm for smallest in list vs iterative for smallest
	Do it iteratively bec it makes sense
Recursive binary search of tree
	Notes on this for my recorded snippet
	If we walk the tree in n order traversal we get sorted list
	Investigate what this means later
	Huffman codE?
Recursion is natural through search
	We can use recursion for searching by dividing the space up
	Plae we have searched and places we have yet to search
	if we get stuck we can back up and try a diff path
The knight's tour
	is it possible for a knight to hit all spaces in chess board
	Recurse and check and stuff
	since we hav eto back up and try again if it doesn'y work, we need to do it recursively
	computers technically don't do recursion
		It just changes state on stack and push and pop self
		Ultimately down to transistors
	
Eight queens
	Queen controls row, column an ddiagonals
	there are more and more solutions as there is more space in the board
	What is the expected runtime of the board
	Step one, print the data structure
		Remember to print the data structure
	First check if spot in the board is safe
		Check row left and right diagonal
		Don't check columns becayse we iter  thru the cols
	If it don't work, we keep backtracking to k to k-1 to k-2 until it works
	Place queen in each row
		Check if it's safe
		If its safe recurse to the next to place the other
	Recursion is good for search problems

Graphs
	Node and edge spider thing not plots.
	social netowrk 
	A graph is a finite set
	It has vertices adn edges
	There is a set of edges
	and a set of vertices
	each edge is a pair of vertices
Repr a graph
	Adjacency matrix
	nxn, unweighted is 0 for no connection 1 for connection
	weighted is number of ewight for connection
Adj matrix
	Each node is a row, all things connected are in the cols
	symmeteric across diagonal is undirected
Asj list
'	Each node is repr in as anentry in column vector
	The list elements contain the dest node and teh weight
	Why prefer this?
		ADJ matrix is n^2
		More pspace efficient for sparse graphs
basic graph algorithms
	Find the thing in the graph
	We need to order it first
	An array would go 0 to n-1 and search
	Two ways of searching
		Breadth first search
		Use a queue
		Explore the set of vertices immediately reachable
		Then repeat the process for each vertex in the set
		AKA level order traversal
		Depth Frist search
			Recursion/stack
			Search as far as possible before backing up
			Iterative DFS
	Trees
		Trees are a special case
		no loop
		DAG directed acyclic graph
		
BREAD FIRST SEARCH
	Capcaity of vertices is queue
	Put vertex in queue
	while queue isnt; emptyy
	dequeue a vertex
	insert the certex
	go thru the vertices and check if we haven't visited it yet, and if we have an edge
	Add it to queue if so

DFS
	SOmething is on the stack
	Pop first off the stack
	Pop a value off the stack and push the lsat onto stack
	Then pop the next one 
	Then push and the pop last
Topological sort
	Sorting depends on sorting shell and heap
	Which depend on sorting shell and heap.c
	Make uses a DAG so that you can check if you can have all the available parts
DF to make topo sort
	

KAHN's alg
	A DAG of G <V,E> 
	STOREs topo ordering list
	Set of vertices with no incoming edges
	First check if v had no incoming edges, add all to list
	While |S|>0
		remove v in set V
	For each u in the vertices where e is <v.u> and e within e
		Add the things and search

return L
Djikstra's algorithm
	For v in all the verts
		Distance from source is inifite
		Predecessor of vertx in unknown
		Dist from s to s
	while s not equal v
		w is a vertex such tat dist is minimum
		if S is in a set of W
		for each adjacent
		If new distance is short update predecessor and updat edistance

Eulerian path
	Visits each edge once
	mega long
